# Business case

## Problem

Every company needs infrastructure to run its software, but deploying and maintaining infrastructure can be complicated, error-prone and time-consuming. Also, most companies have the same core set of infrastructure needs, so redundantly implementing what is already built is a poor use of company resources.

## Traditional solutions

In the past, companies dealing with the complexity of infrastructure had two primary options:

1. **Outsource DevOps.** Outsourcing options hide the lower-level details so it's easy to get started, but hard to customize, debug and scale.
1. **Build everything from scratch.** This gives the team full control, but at the significant cost of assembling everything themselves.

Gruntwork offers a third option: **Accelerated DevOps.**

## The Gruntwork solution

In the Gruntwork model, you retain full control of your infrastructure and use Gruntwork to *accelerate* your DevOps capabilities by using pre-built, best-in-class implementations that can be adapted to a wide range of common use cases, and which come with extensive documentation, automated tests, and commercial support. 

### Benefits

- **Speed.** Launch faster by not re-inventing the wheel.
- **Confidence.** Setup infrastructure the "right" way upfront.
- **Reduce cost.** Offload significant ongoing maintenance costs and gain access to future updates by leveraging the Gruntwork engineering team.
- **Community.** Get access to an active community all using the same building blocks.
- **Resilience.** Streamline the way your future team members ramp up.

### Costs

- **Money.** Gruntwork is a paid product.
- **Learning time.** It takes time to learn Gruntwork the product and Gruntwork opinions.
- **Customization time.** Gruntwork handles the "grunt work" of infrastructure, but you are still responsible for customizing it to your particular needs.

### Requirements

- **DevOps Ownership.** Someone at your organization must "own" the infrastructure. This could be an experienced DevOps engineer, software engineer learning DevOps, outside consultant, or anyone else committed to developing the skills necessary to succeed at DevOps.
- **DevOps Skill.** Gruntwork requires that users learn at least the following core DevOps skills:
  - Terraform: Intermediate
  - Bash: Beginner
  - Packer: Beginner
  - Docker: Intermediate

  *In the Gruntwork model, the user takes responsibility for developing these skills, however Gruntwork assists this effort by offering [DevOps Courses](/courses), [Professional Services](#), and [Support](#).*
