# Business case

Every company needs infrastructure to run its software, but deploying and maintaining infrastructure can get extremely complicated. In the past, companies dealing with this complexity were faced with two primary options:

1. **Build everything from scratch.** This gave the team full control, but at the significant cost of assembling everything themselves.
2. **Outsource DevOps.** All outsourcing options hide the lower-level details so it's easy to get started, but hard to customize, debug and scale.

Gruntwork offers a third option: **Accelerated DevOps.**

## Accelerated DevOps

In the Accelerated DevOps model, Gruntwork provides:

- Hundreds of thousands of lines of pre-written, production-grade, battle-tested infrastructure code that work like "building blocks" of infrastructure.
- The option to achieve compliance out-of-the-box 
- Opinions on best practices.
- 

## Why Gruntwork

Gruntwork is considered a world expert in DevOps, Terraform, AWS, and Software:

  - [cloud-nuke](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke)
  - [git-xargs](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/git-xargs)



either by building everything inhouse, or by outsourcing DevOps to a third party.


*outsourcing* DevOps to a third-party such as a [Managed Service Provider](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/msp/) or Platform as a Service (PaaS) like Heroku, or by owning it inhouse.

When teams own DevOps inhouse, they gain total control over their infrastructure, but at the cost of m 

1. Outsource DevOps
2. Build internal DevOps expertise



In the Gruntwork model, users are the primary owners of their infrastructure, however most companies rebuild the same core set of infrastructure, setting up world-class DevOps infrastructure from scratch is time-consuming and error-prone.



The Gruntwork product collection contains pre-written, production-grade infrastructure-as-code for AWS that contains all of the "building blocks" for going to prod, including Docker orchestration (e.g. Kubernetes, ECS), CI/CD pipeline configuration (e.g. using GitHub Actions, GitLab, etc.), databases and more.

- Business case
  - Most developers are builders, but focus on the business problem (get live quickly) not the technical problem (how do I manually build this infra?)
    - Don't reinvent the wheel and make the same mistakes
    - You need this time to focus on your core business
  - What about maintenance
    - What about when someone leaves?
    - What about when a new critical project comes up?
  - DevOps engineers are really hard to hire and it takes a long time
  - Even coming up with requirements is time-consuming
  - Make infra your competitive advantage
  - But key is that you own it
  - Timeline
    - Up and running (1 day)
    - First app (3 days?)
  - After working with so many startups over the years, it became very apparent that a lot of what tech companies need is repeatable.
