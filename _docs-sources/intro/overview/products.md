- An optional *catalog extension* that contains building blocks that implement various compliance standards such as CIS, SOC 2, and HIPAA ([Gruntwork Compliance](#)).
- A collection of *professional services* including:
  - Gruntwork assembles your architecture in about a day ([Reference Architecture](#)).
  - Gruntwork engineers:
    - Pair with you to learn how to use Gruntwork products.
    - Customize Gruntwork products to your use case.
- *Support* via a community-only Slack workspace and our Knowledge Base, and optionally via a private Slack channel and email, backed by SLAa ([Support](#)).

## Raw notes



either by building everything inhouse, or by outsourcing DevOps to a third party.


*outsourcing* DevOps to a third-party such as a [Managed Service Provider](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/msp/) or Platform as a Service (PaaS) like Heroku, or by owning it inhouse.

When teams own DevOps inhouse, they gain total control over their infrastructure, but at the cost of m 

1. Outsource DevOps
2. Build internal DevOps expertise



In the Gruntwork model, users are the primary owners of their infrastructure, however most companies rebuild the same core set of infrastructure, setting up world-class DevOps infrastructure from scratch is time-consuming and error-prone.



The Gruntwork product collection contains pre-written, production-grade infrastructure-as-code for AWS that contains all of the "building blocks" for going to prod, including Docker orchestration (e.g. Kubernetes, ECS), CI/CD pipeline configuration (e.g. using GitHub Actions, GitLab, etc.), databases and more.
